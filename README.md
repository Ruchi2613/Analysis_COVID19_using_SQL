The COVID-19 pandemic was a significant global event that claimed lives and severely impacted the economy. In this micro-project, I analyzed COVID-19 data using SQL. The dataset spans from February 24, 2020, to April 30, 2021, and was sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

The dataset includes information on cases, deaths, and vaccinations. For clarity, I divided the data into two separate files using Excel: **CovidDeaths** (focusing on cases and deaths) and **CovidVaccinations** (covering vaccinations and tests). The entire project was conducted using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

The SQL query file is available in the project documentation folder.  

The goal of this project was to apply fundamental SQL skills to analyze a real-world scenarioâ€”the COVID-19 pandemic.
